# CSharp Practical

This repository belongs to: **Victor Ferreira**

This repository contains challenges and exercises to practise C\# language.

Each chapter contains a number of challenges. Some may come with solutions other may not. Most of them are accompanied by Unit Tests.

All challenges contain at least a `README.md` describing the task at hand. Most already contain a Visual Studio solution to start from.
